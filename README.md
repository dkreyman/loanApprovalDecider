Using a neural network to decide whether or not to approve someone for a peer to peer loan. 
This is a really exciting and practical application of machine learning!

This script uses a Kaggle dataset from LendingClub.com
First I did some visual anylasis with seaborn and matplotlib of the data then I cleaned & preprocessed the data. 
And I finally I trained a model with tensor flow to predict how likely someone is to pay back the loan!

In the future I may create a front end where you can put in a users information and get a back a score for how good of a candidate they are.
Or perhaps I can simply use the model to make decisions for me and automatically loan out money.
